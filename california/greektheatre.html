    <h1>Info</h1>
    <p>The Greek Theatre, nicknamed "The Greek", is a 5,870-seat Greek theatre, located at Griffith Park, in Los Angeles, California. It was built in 1929, opening on September 29 of that year. The Greek Theatre is owned by the city of Los Angeles, and is managed, operated and promoted by the Nederlander Organization. Designed by architect Samuel Tilden Norton, the theatre stage is modeled after a Greek temple.
</p>
    <p>The idea for the Greek Theatre originated with wealthy landowner Griffith J. Griffith, who donated 3,000 acres of land to the city of Los Angeles in 1896 to create what became Griffith Park. In his will he left money for the construction of a Greek theatre. A canyon site was chosen because of its good acoustics. The cornerstone was laid in 1928 and the building was officially dedicated in 1930. The first performance took place in 1931, attended by a capacity crowd of 4,000.</p>

    <p>The Greek Theatre is used for concerts, stage shows, and graduation ceremonies for Thomas Starr King Middle School and John Marshall High School, among others.
The Greek Theatre won the Best Small Outdoor Venue award seven times in the past eight years, awarded by Pollstar Magazine, the industry's leading trade publication.</p>
